      <description>Did I just have a stroke? 여기서 stroke은 뇌졸증이라고 해석할 수 있습니다. 이를 약간은 의역하자면 내가 뇌졸증에 걸렸나?보단 내 머리가 이상해졌나? 이정도로 생각해보면 될 것 같습니다.
All the things you do when you know where your next thousand lays are coming from. 이 말 앞에는 마샬, 릴리가 약혼 후에 더욱 성숙해지고자 북클럽에 가입하고, 와인파티를 한다는 내용이 있습니다. 여기서 바니가 위의 대사를 하는데 이러한 것들(성숙해지고자 하는 행동들)은 where your next thousand lays are coming from을 알때나 하는 행동이라는 뜻입니다.</description>

      <description>Do they rule? They rule.
It&#39;s the one night of the year chicks use to unleash their inner ho-bag
trot out your new fella
It was carve3d in strategic places
She could be engaged, or married, or, God forbid, fat
Oh, yeah. Weirdly hor, right?
What are you going as? Oh, like I evend need to ask.
What? She thought it was hilarious
What a sad commentary on our national attention span, that we could forget such a turbulent time in our political history</description>

      <description>Yeah, we do that behind you back.
You&#39;re messing with me, right?
Summer Breeze is my guilty-pleasure song.
Well, by some million-to-one long shot, and I&#39;m not rooting for this, you wind up not getting married this weekend, give me a call
Brace yourself, dude.</description>

      <description>You&#39;re making this up.
Never even saw the bus.
Just keep your eyes open.
But this girl, she wants the same stuff, and it&#39;s bumming me out.
But in the meantime, wish me luck.
May lead to an argument, but we&#39;re settling this.
Is this a discussion of the degree to which you stabbed me?</description>

      <description>Okay, Lily, we&#39;re putting you on salad duty.
Why are we even talking about this? This is, like, way down the road.
All is right with the world again.
Look, I don&#39;t wanna be exactly like my family. And don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but I don&#39;t wanna be exactly like your family, either.
Just a little joke to lighten up the mood.</description>

      <description>Hey, it&#39;s on the hous.
Ted, as your mentor and spiritual guide, I forbid you from calling her.
Sleep it off, bro.
This way, if you pass out in the gutter someone with call me, and I will come get you.
Why do they call it &amp;lsquo;karaoke,&amp;rsquo; anyhow?
You&#39;ve moved on. I&#39;ve moved on.</description>

      <description>She seems like she might be into me.
I&#39;ve moved up in the world.
Oh, well, my word.
Can we swing by the aprtment so I can change?
Ted, Derek stood me up.
What are the odds?
Oh, nuts.
Give it a rest, Ted.</description>

      <description>We never really clicked.
Tehy were buried in a shallow grave.
I&#39;m just saying that it&#39;s my wedding, too, and I should have a say in it.
Did you see how fired up she was?</description>

      <description>It was her big break.
Like just now, when I saw you doing the Chicken Dance out there, I&#39;m not gonna lie to you, big time thunderbolt.
Robin, care to chime in with anything?
You know, there&#39;s one little flaw in our plan.</description>

      <description>Awkward conversations with middle-aged couples trying to stave off divorce.
That snuck up on me.
I mean, the whole point was not to rush into this.
Honey, Ted has been going out of his mind waiting for this.</description>

      <description>I am smelling dirt.
You guys will pick it up.
Prude-alert.
Slut-alert.
Whatevs.
As long as you&#39;re nailing that.
Listen to you.
And FYI, Shannon and I have decided to wait till we&#39;re married.
Way to step up.
My saga continues.
You let me dodge a bullet, Big Guy.</description>

      <description>All tuckered out.
Man, you really have snapped.
That&#39;s the spirit.
Oh, Robin, are you tearing up?
Well, look, if you absolutely must bring Ted, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to claw my own eyes out if he comes.</description>
