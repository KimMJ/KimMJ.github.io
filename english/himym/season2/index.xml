      <description>Hey, cut her some slack.
Do you know why you&#39;re not over Lily yet?
I think he&#39;s beyond repair.
Eat Haagen-Dazs and watch Love Actually till your periods sync up?
That&#39;s really the only reason I&#39;ve been able to hold it together so far this summer.
You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall, and frankly, a guy like you doesn&#39;t have a shot in hell with a girl like Lily.</description>

      <description>Lily calling off the wedding and dumping me?
Marshall and Lily had seen each other since breaking up, but to their credit, it wasn&#39;t that awkward.
It&#39;s kind of revealing.
I&#39;ve been doing all these toe lifts lately, and so my calves have really been cramping up.
To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses.
Way to wreck the curve, kiss ass.
The woman&#39;s basically a ride at a water park.</description>
